# WebOS

## *The project is being completely rewritting.*
Our original design is a operational web-based GUI using pure JS.
The WASM standard are now application-ready, as well as WebGPU standard. 
We saw projects like `JSLinux`, `x86` and `webContainer`, proved that running programs on web platform is 100% possible.
The new goal of the project is to write a V8 -> NodeJS polyfill like `webContainer` and we're doing a complete rewritting using Rust.
